<strong> </strong>Create below page layout by using HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap (v4.5)

In the header section, you will have Logo, Home, About, Projects, and Contact as menu items (no need for Login). Links on the left panel will be city names (London, Paris, Tokyo).




The links on the left menu should take the user to corresponding sections on the same page (there will be one single html page). You can include any proper content for the right panel or leave it empty. Change the background colors for the left and right panels so they become visible on the page.

<strong> </strong>

You can use below text for different city descriptions. Pictures for the cities should be floated to the left so that city descriptions will wrap around the images.  You can find image files for cities within img.zip file. Make sure you use relative path for defining source of each image. (i.e. img/london.jpg)

See below page for css float property.
